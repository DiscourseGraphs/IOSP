    - > AlphaFold2 was initially released without the capability to model protein complexes. However, we found that by combining two sequences with a glycine linker20 it could often successfully model complexes. Shortly afterwards, Baek21 found that increasing the model's internal parameter, residue-index (the method that was used in RoseTTAFold), could also be done in AlphaFold2.
  
  For high-quality predictions it was shown that sequences should be provided in paired form to AlphaFold2 (ref. 22)
